To test cases folder recursively (all ``.txt`` files):
    mvn test
Don't forget to create a dbconn.properties and place it in this
directory before invoking `mvn test`; otherwise, the unittests won't know
what database to connect to!

To test a specific folder recursively or a specific file:
    mvn test -Dtest.cases="[folder/file]"
(Windows users may need to quote the command slightly differently):
    mvn test "-Dtest.cases=[folder/file]"

To test with a specific server credential:
    mvn test -Dcredential="[server_URL];[db_name];[username];[password]"

To run flight app:
    mvn compile exec:java

To build jar with dependency and then run that jar:
    mvn compile assembly:single
    java -jar target/FlightApp-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
